This project is a social media chat analyzer built with Python and nlp. The application provides various analyses on a chat log, including top statistics, activity timelines, activity maps, word cloud, most common words, emoji analysis, and sentiment analysis. The analysis can be done for a specific user or for the overall chat.


# Project description: 

You can use your WhatsApp data for many data science tasks like sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, named entity recognition, text analysis and several other natural language processing tasks. It also depends on who you are analysing your WhatsApp messages with because you can find a lot of information from your WhatsApp messages which can also help you to solve business problems.

In this project you are expected to perform the analysis on the WhatsApp chat data and share the insights of it,

1.	Loading the chat data into python environment
2.	Defining the specific function or methods for preprocessing the text data
3.	Incorporating NLP techniques for cleaning the text data
4.	Creating Word Clouds of the processed chat data
5.	Save the images of word cloud into your system.
6.	Extracting information through sentiment analysis.

Before starting with the task of WhatsApp Chat analysis with Python you need to extract your WhatsApp data from your smartphone which is a very easy task. To extract your WhatsApp chats, just open any chat with a person or a group and follow the steps mentioned below:
